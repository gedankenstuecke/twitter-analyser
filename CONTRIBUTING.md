🎉 Thanks so much for your interest in contributing! You're the best! 🎈

Right now we don't have a detailed plan of what we want to work on next. But here are some important things to know.

### Overview
1. We do [have a Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that you should have read. 👍
2. Have a look at the open issues to see what could be improved.

### Missing things
1. We don't have any tests so far. If you feel that is something you enjoy: Please go ahead! 😎
2. More data analysis!


### Making some $£¥€
In case you have a great idea for how to improve this project: Open Humans is [offering $5,000 as project grants for ideas that improve/grow the Open Humans eco-system](https://www.openhumans.org/grants/). And guess what: This project would totally qualify. So if you want to work on this, you could even be paid. 😂

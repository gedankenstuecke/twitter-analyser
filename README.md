The [TwArχiv](http://twarxiv.org) is a *Twitter Archive Analyzer* that is designed to take in a complete *Twitter archive* as downloaded from Twitter.com and subsequently analyse it with respect to the number of tweets/replies etc. On the most basic level it displays how a persons tweeting frequency changes over time and how the proportion of tweets/retweets/replies changes over time.
The [TwArχiv](http://twarxiv.org) additionally tries to predict the gender of the people that a given user retweets and replies to, potentially uncovering unconscious bias when it comes to online interactions.
Furthermore, the [TwArχiv](http://twarxiv.org) uses the geolocation to display a Tweet-location and movement profile for the user.

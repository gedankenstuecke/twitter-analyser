          The amount we tweet per day can change over time. This data can be
          really noisy: On some days we might hammer out one tweet after the other,
          while on other days we don't get around to doing much tweeting at all.
          There might be vacations, days where you're sick in bed etc. This can make
          it very hard to see long-term trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason the data here was
          averaged to remove the noise. This was done by applying a rolling average
          on a 180 day window. This should make it much easier to see how one's
          behaviour changed over larger time-frames (In <code>pandas</code> this
          rolling average is created by
          <code>
            dataframe.rolling('180d').mean()
          </code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          In our graph to the left the <code>x-axis</code> gives us the time since
          one signed up for <i>Twitter</i> and the <code>y-axis</code> gives the
          normalized number of tweets on a given day.

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
          There are different types of tweets one can send on Twitter. Some tweets
          are <code>replies</code> to tweets by other users, while other tweets are
          <code>retweets</code> of tweets done by other users.
          Last, but not least there are the good old <code>regular tweets</code>,
          which are neither a reply to anyone nor a retweet of a tweet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, this data might be very noisy due to short-time changes.
          For this reason the data was averaged to remove the noise as well.
          This was done by applying the same rolling average on a 180 day window as above.
          This should make it much easier to see how one's
          behaviour changed over larger time-frames (In <code>pandas</code> this

          Different people have different styles in how they use Twitter. Some
          are owls and tweet deep into the night, while others of us are larks
          and send our first tweets out while the sun rises. And of course, there
          might be differences between workdays and weekends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twitter does not save the local time in which a tweet was sent. Instead
          it gives all dates and times in <code>UTC</code>. To get the correct local time
          it is thus necessary to know the latitude/longitude from which a given
          tweet was sent. Correspondingly our graph to the left is based purely on those
          tweets for which a geo location is known.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our graph to the left the <code>x-axis</code> gives us the hour of the
          day in which tweets were sent and the <code>y-axis</code> gives us the overall
          number of (geotagged) tweets that were sent on a given workday or day of the weekend.

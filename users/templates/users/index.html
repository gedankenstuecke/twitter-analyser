            <li><b>Request your Twitter archive from the <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data">Twitter website</a></b><br>
              Visit the
              <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data">
                Twitter data page
              </a> and enter your password to request your data. Generating the
              data will take Twitter some time. Once it is ready you will
              get an email from Twitter with a link where you can download the data.
            </li>
            <li><b>Log in or create an Open Humans account</b><br>
              You can upload your Twitter archive into this account once Twitter
              has created it.
            </li>
            <li><b>Authorize the <font color="#1DA1F2">Tw</font>Arχiv in Open Humans</b><br>
              This authorizes us to deposit your archive into your Open Humans account.</li>
            <li><b>Extract your Tweets from the archive</b><br>
              Open the zipped archive file that you downloaded from Twitter and
              extract the <code>tweet.js</code> file from it.
            </li>
            <li><b>Upload your tweets.</b><br>
              You will be redirected back to the <font color="#1DA1F2">Tw</font>Arχiv and can then
              upload your archive data.
              You'll be able to
              <a href="{{ oh_proj_page }}">access &amp; manage your data on
              Open Humans</a>.
